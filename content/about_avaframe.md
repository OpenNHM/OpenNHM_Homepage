AvaFrame is a cooperation between the Austrian Avalanche and Torrent Service
(Wildbach- und Lawinenverbauung; WLV) and the Austrian Research Centre for
Forests (Bundesforschungszentrum f√ºr Wald; BFW) within the Federal Ministry
Republic of Austria: Agriculture, Forestry, Regions and Water Management (BML).

Our mission is to

---

**Develop an open source framework (licensed with the European Union Public 
license (EUPL) ) for avalanche simulations which replicates and simplifies 
current simulation procedures and models at the WLV and make them accessible 
to the public domain.**

---

Our aims are to make AvaFrame:
+ applicable in an operational setting e.g. for hazard mapping or planning of
mitigation measures within the WLV and civil engineering.
+ extensible for scientific applications to be used to develop new methods,
models and cover a wide range of scientific topics. 
+ easily usable and extendable by (inter-)national partners, academia and interested users.

AvaFrame is part of an BML initiative to foster technological innovation
within a strategic focus on the area of Austrian safety policies, digital
innovations and climate mitigation strategies.
