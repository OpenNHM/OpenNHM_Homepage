**Today we released [Version 1.5.1](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.5.1)** 

This is a bugfix release:

FIX
- For version 1.5 ANY simulation with com1DFA was marked as C (for changed) instead of D (for default), even in the 
case of no changes via local_ cfgs files. This is resolved now.
