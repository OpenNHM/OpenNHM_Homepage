Welcome to the March 2022 update.

As you might have noticed by all the other posts, this month saw our 1st public workshop. In case you missed it, see the
previous post for a link to the recording of it. 

We are still working on the first release, expected to be released within the next few weeks (probably beginning of
April).

- Improve plots. One is hillshade and contours for peak plots 

- update documentation, add info about ata viscosity

- fix stuff in relation to the connectior, i.e. a b is optional now

- new ana5utils with thalweg time and simulogram

- fix missing tau0 in friction relation

the first release candidate. See [github releases](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases) for a full changelog.
