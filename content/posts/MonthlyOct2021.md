Welcome to the first winter edition of the monthly update!

This has been a month with a lot of internal development, but not much of it landed on the master branch just yet. 

The topics we are tackling at the moment are:

- investigation of the  initial particle distribution, we are trying different options
  and check to see if there is a significant change in the results. Aim is to make this easier to reproduce and less
  arbitrary.

- another method of splitting (and potentially merging) of particles is being developed. This relates to particle masses
and consistent handling in the numerical schemes. 

- we have the pleasure of welcoming an intern to our team: Amaury. Expect to see code and other contributions coming
from him. He will be working on investigating DFA kernel convergence (together with Matthias). 

- the first of the AvaFrame related master thesis results are coming closer. The first code from Marie has landed and is
being integrated in the code base. Exciting stuff related to path generation, hybrid / combination modeling of com1DFA
(dense flow) and com2AB (alpha beta). 

- we are now beginning the process of bringing end users with operational background in, getting feedback and stumbling
on all those pesky little teething problems. Thanks to all those taking time for this, your contribution is highly
valued!

That's it for this month, see you 

Felix
