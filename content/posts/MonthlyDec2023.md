Welcome to the last update for  2023 :

The (side project) ISeeSnow is in full swing, we are getting the first results from different groups in. With this 
comes (as always) as few tiny niggles, that we addressed this month. These are mostly related to aimec and plotting 
functions. 

Furthermore we are gearing up for our next release and are in the the testing phase for including com6RockAvalanche 
also into our QGis connector. Stay tuned for the next release. 

With this we hope you had a nice year 2023 and wish you a Happy New Year 2024.

Felix
