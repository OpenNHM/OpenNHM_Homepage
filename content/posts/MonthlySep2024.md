Welcome to the September 2024 update:

Work this month includes:

- fixing an annoying bug with an updated external module. Sorry to all affected users. 
- in relation to the ISeeSnow paper, we improved some plotting routines
- a new (work in progress) gallery to show the available plots in AvaFrame, see [here](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/Visualisation.html#gallery)

And we welcome a new [intern](https://github.com/leon-wagner), already tackling issues around documentation, ini 
files and more.
