Welcome to the June 2022 update.

This seems to be a recurring update lately: we are nearly at a rate of one release per month (this makes
my life in regards to these monthly updates a lot easier...).

To know what went on, head over to the [release info](/posts/version1_2/) of *version 1.2*.

So we recommend you update your installations, you will find the instructions at our
documentation at the end of the [installation instructions](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/installation.html).

As always: if you run into problems or if you have ideas and feedback, don't hesitate to contact us!

I'm signing off for summer now, gonna change the topic away from snow and enjoy some sun and warm weather for a change!

Felix
