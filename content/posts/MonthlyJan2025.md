Welcome to the first update of 2025:

Major work is being done of a change on our input side: we are including support for geotiff files. We will of 
course keep the asc format, but the geotiff format allows for a better integration and 
checks in relation to geographic information (i.e. coordinates, projections, etc.). Expect this to be released with 
a new version within the next weeks. 

Work on the ISeeSnow paper is progressing nicely, as well as the work on our regional modelling project. 

com4FlowPy is also constantly receiving a lot of attention and new features. All main development efforts are now 
running  completely in the AvaFrame codebase. 

And as a sidenote: currently we are in the final stages of starting a sister project to AvaFrame, called DebrisFrame.
Related to, as the name suggests, debris flows (who would have guessed).

So lets get this year going, see you next month!

Felix
