**We just released version 0.2 - The test data release -**

Version 0.2 includes the first real world avalanches. It provides data for 6
avalanches, including topographies, release areas and benchmark results.
To know more about our data sources, head over to
[our data sources documentation](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/dataSources.html).
The existing test cases also received some updates by including multiple release
areas and multiple scenarios per avalanche.

All our standard test can be run by using ```runStandardTests.py``` in the
```AvaFrame/avaframe``` directory. This is a good start to see all results at
once, however be aware this script takes some time (if all tests are run; see
top of the script).

For a documentation on how to add a test see 
[our development section](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/develop.html#how-to-add-a-benchmark-test).

This release is also the first to include [API documentation](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/api.html)
for our modules and functions.
However not all functions are included yet, but we are working on this. 

Contributors to version 0.2:

- **Data: C. Tollinger, M.Granig**
- **Data: Land Tirol**
- **Code: core team**
