The project AvaFrame has officially started with the 1st of June!

We updated the [about](/about) page with our mission and aims.
Information in German can be found [here](https://www.bmlrt.gv.at/forst/wildbach-lawinenverbauung/kooperationen-zusammenarbeit/lawinenschutzvorsorgeprojekt.html).

The first steering committee and scientific committee meetings already took
place and our team members will start soon. 

We will continuously keep you updated on this homepage.
