**We are very excited to be able to announce our initial release version 0.1!**

This release is the result of several months of development, containing code

release*. So expect some (read: a lot of) rough edges!

You should be able to follow our [quick

far) and produce simulation results for dense flow avalanches.  And yes,
nice pictures are also included :-).
