Welcome the first (close to) winter update of October 2022.

The main thing this month was the release of version 1.3, please head over to the 
[release info](/posts/version1_3/) of *version 1.3* to read more about it. 

This meant a lot of work went into bug squashing, removal of minor niggles and improvement of the documentation. 

Please be aware that the installation method for QGis changed significantly. The AvaFrameConnector now tries 
to install the python package automatically. Hopefully this makes is a bit easier to get started. We also provide
and update function in the AvaFrameConnector. 

So we recommend you update your installations. You will find the instructions at our
documentation at the end of the [installation instructions](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/installation.html).

As always: if you run into problems or if you have ideas and feedback, don't hesitate to contact us!

Felix
