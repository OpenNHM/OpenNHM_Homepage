We invite you to join our first monthly *public update meeting* on

**Tuesday, 15. June, 9:30**

via this link: [online meeting (bigbluebutton, i.e. in your browser)](https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl/fel-rsy-bxv-7aw).

These meetings are meant to allow you to see what is currently going on in our
development and we invite you to give feedback or suggestions. 

We start with a flash update in which everyone working on the project gives a
quick (2min) overview about their current work. Afterwards we go into detailed
discussions on agenda topics. Feel free to contribute if you want to!
