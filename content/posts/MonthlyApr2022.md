Welcome to the April 2022 update.

The info in here is a bit short... This is because there's a separate post about the main
event this month: **Version 1.0 is out**!!
Please head over there to get the full info on this. 

Apart from this we worked on:

- a few fixes regarding init files
- reworking a few AIMEC functions and calculating real areas in this regard
- a few minor bugs are fixed
- added various documentation bits, especially the installation instructions. Currently 
  we are offering to different setups for you to choose. One for operational settings and on for
  development purposes. Please head over to our documentation https://docs.avaframe.org to find out more
- we are in the process of writing peer reviewed papers. Will take a while :-) 

And now on to the version 1.0 announcement. 

Felix
