Welcome to the October 2023 update:

We released a new version related to our benchmarking file, see[github] 
(https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.7) to get more information. 

Again we updated and adjusted a few minor things for the ISeeSnow project, see here: [ISeeSnow repo](https://github.
com/avaframe/ISeeSnow). And we are still working on our final report for phase 1, which will also be published on 
this webpage.
