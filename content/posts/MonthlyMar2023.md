Well, again: another month, some more releases:

But this time these are only minor releases with bugfixes. See infos here: 
[release info 1.5.1](/posts/version1_5_1/) and [release info 1.5.2](/posts/version1_5_2/).

- We are still working on probability map generation. 

- We started to rework the glossary, focusing on topics that are relevant for our framework. We are not trying to 
  replicate any 'standard' glossary for the snow and avalanche field. It is meant to clarify what we are talking 
  about and how we define certain keywords. 

- We fixed some bugs, mainly in com1DFA and plotting
