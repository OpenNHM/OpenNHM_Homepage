Welcome to the February update:

This month we held the 1st Austrian workshop (in German), [see here for the recording](https://avaframe.org/posts/recording1statworkshop/).

We also released [Version 1.8](https://avaframe.org/posts/version1_8/) with new computational modules for rock 
avalanches and FlowPy. Please head over to the link above to see all the details of this release. 

The rock avalanche module is highly experimental but will be extended in future developments. Please check our 
[documentation](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/moduleCom6RockAvalanche.html) to see the requirements and other 
information.
