Welcome to the first installment of our monthly update on AvaFrame. 

Every month we want to give you a quick overview of the progress on all things
related to AvaFrame. 

+ This month the project went into full force with 2 new team members: we
 welcome Anna Wirbel and Matthias Tonnel to the team! More info on the whole
 team will follow on this homepage. 

+ The first (development) code is available on [github](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame)
  + Includes the first module with AlphaBeta calculations
  + Continuous Integration is setup (using pytest and github actions for now) 
  + Some test data (simple slide topography) is included

+ Documentation is setup  on readthedocs
  [docs.avaframe.org](https://docs.avaframe.org), with some information related
  to developing AvaFrame and the AlphaBeta module already being included
 
+ In the background we are collecting/analysing code from various projects, 
related to
    + dense flow avalanches
    + utilities for topographies
    + benchmark / test cases to be used in testing
