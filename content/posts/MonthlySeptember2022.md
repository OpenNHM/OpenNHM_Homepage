Welcome to the September 2022 update.

This was the month of conferences:
First was the International Mountain Conference on our door steps in Innsbruck. 
We had a session about *Gravitational mass flow simulations for avalanches* with a bunch of very interesting talks. Thanks 
again to everyone who contributed and visited. The program can be found [here](https://www.conftool.com/imc2022/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=186). 

We also took this opportunity to hold the *Scientific Meeting*, discussing, among other things, the future direction AvaFrame takes. We cannot share details yet, 
but we are excited!

The second conference took place in Davos, Switzerland, the *International Symposium on Snow*. Again thanks to all who we had discussions and feedback from. See 
[the proceedings (abstract 91A3947)](https://www.igsoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/procabstracts_79.html) for our contribution. 

But of course we did not forget to add new stuff to AvaFrame itself :-). We worked on the Thalweg-Time diagram, updated the installation instructions and fixed 
a few (annoying) bugs. 

Oh and: the next version is getting closer and closer. 

Winter is also coming closer (at least for us northern hemisphere people)...
