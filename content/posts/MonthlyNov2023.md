Welcome to the November 2023 update:

First up the most important news: we are happy to announce the start of AvaFrame Phase 2! Phase 2 will take place 
for the next 5 years, and we have many exciting updates and topics planned for it. 

With this comes the closure of phase 1 and the final report available under [reports](https://avaframe.org/reports/) 
(German only). We thank all the contributors and people giving feedback. Your ideas and comments are very much 
appreciated!

However, our normal work doesn't stop, so we added quite a few things. We now include the secondary release areas 
in the release volume computation. We started adding two more computational modules, one is the integration of 
flowpy into com4FlowPy and the second is com6RockAvalanche. Com6 makes use of com1 to investigate rock avalanches. 
This development was triggered by the Fluchthorn rock avalanche and will be pursued in more depth in a future 
development.
