Welcome to the June 2024 update:

We took part in the [Interpraevent 2024](https://interpraevent2024.at/programme/workshop) conference in Vienna with 
a workshop about AvaFrame. The room was full, and it was cool to see so much interest in our project.

There was also a talk and a poster with AvaFrame references:
- Michael MÃ¶lk: Rock-avalanche Fluchthorn: Back-calculation of the event with the open source model AvaFrame
- Oesterle et.al: The AvaFrame digital toolbox for avalanches as a component of natural hazard risk assessment 

You will find these topics in the proceedings too, which at the moment are only preliminary:

Code wise we worked on small fixes, com4FlowPy and the documentation. And a project to improve rock avalanche 
simulations in cooperation with the University of Graz started.
