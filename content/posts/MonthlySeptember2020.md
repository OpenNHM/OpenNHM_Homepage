We created a new results folder structure for com1DFA, now simulation files can be addressed according to their name and characteristics such as simulation type, name of release area and many more via a dictionary.

Now there is also the option to vary not only the friction parameter mu but also the release thickness. Besides this new option, more and more simulation parameters can now be set in python.

My this month in avaframe would be:
*Working on the comparison tool AIMEC:
-Main routine Ana3AIMEC clead up and tested
-Documentation up to date
-Some further development on the ploting routine on its way
*Creating a colormap siuted for avalanche data visualisation:
-Discrete cmap for end users with predefined levels
-continuous cmap for developers
*Writting theory doc for com1DFA
