Welcome to the November 2024 update:

We released a new version this month, please head over to [Version 1.9](https://github. 
com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.9)  to see the details.

A new friction model is available, the spatialVoellmy friction model. It allows to read mu/xi 
values from a raster during initialization. We included this for our project ForestFrame 2, which investigates the 
handling of resistance areas, i.e. forests, in com1DFA. Expect a few more changes in the upcoming months related to 
the treatment of this. 

The regional modelling project is also coming along nicely. We are currently working on the requirements and use 
cases to determine the requirements for the new module. We will keep you updated on this.

And on the admin side: we had our Steering Meeting this month, giving report about our progess. 

See you next month and enjoy the first (usable) snow in the Alps!
Felix
