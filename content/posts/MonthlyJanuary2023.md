Ok, so let this year begin!

This month's main thing was the release of version 1.4; please head over to the [release
info](/posts/version1_4/) of *version 1.4* to read more about it. 

Please note that we did not include an update to the AvaFrameConnector for QGis. We have
bug reports of unexpected crashes on Windows, and we are trying to determine the cause. 

The parallel computation is now included in the master branch and will end up in the next release. 

And finally, the preprint of our com1DFA article is open for discussion, head over to
[GMD](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1291/) for more
information. 

As always: if you run into problems or have ideas and feedback, don't hesitate to contact us!

Felix
