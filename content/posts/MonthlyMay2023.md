Welcome to the May 2023 update:

This month we worked on one important user facing change, namely a new function to create release area information 
from a given DEM and corresponding release area files. This gives a summary about area, real area, mean inclination 
etc. This might be helpful to get a "feel" about the release area setup. 

Furthermore, we fixed a few bugs in regards to the documentation and plotting. And we also added acceleration 
information to the particles.
