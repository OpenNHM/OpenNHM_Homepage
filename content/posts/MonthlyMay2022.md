Welcome to the May 2022 update.

Bevor you keep reading here, head over to the [release info](/posts/version1_1/) of *version 1.1* to get all 
changes that went into it. These changes are basically what we mainly worked on 
during this month. 

However, two additional bits went on:
- the ongoing writing of peer-reviewed papers
- and in relation to that, the EGU 2022 took place. The following contributions are related to AvaFrame:
  - Tonnel, M., Wirbel, A., Oesterle, F., and Fischer, J.-T.: Are avalanche models correct? 
    An uncertain view on convergence, EGU General Assembly 2022, Vienna, Austria, 23–27 May 2022, 
    [https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-7745](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-7745), 2022. 
  - Neuhauser, M., Neurauter, R., Tuermer, S., Gerstmayr, J., Adams, M., Koehler, A., and Fischer, J.-T.: 
    Investigating the potential of GNSS-modules for inflow avalanche measurements, EGU General Assembly 2022, 
    Vienna, Austria, 23–27 May 2022, EGU22-6416, 
    [https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-6416](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-6416), 2022. 

That's it for this month, and thanks for all the fruitful discussions at the EGU!
