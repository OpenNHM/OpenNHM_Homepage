Welcome to the March update:

This was a quiet month coding-wise, but not so quiet in project planning terms. We are preparing for the 
[EGU 24 ISeeSnow presentation and meeting](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-17750.html).
We are also planning how to proceed with the big topics of AvaFrame Phase2 (e.g. powder snow avalanches).
