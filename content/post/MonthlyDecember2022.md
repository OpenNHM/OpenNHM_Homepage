Welcome to the last update of this year.

Another new tool was added to AvaFrame: calculating glide snow avalanches using the
*com1DFA* module. This required significant internal additions like a new particle
initialization method, adding bonds between particles and some other numerical functions.
This, and the documentation, will end up in the next release, which is coming soon. 

We are also working on indicating within the simulation names of com1DFA whether the
default parameters were used or something was changed. You'll also find this in the next
release. 

Apart from these topics, we finally submitted our first paper with all the gory details of
our com1dfa theory. Let's see how this goes. And we are working on running multiple
simulations in parallel, finally using all those bored CPU cores you got lying around.

With that, thanks for all the feedback we got this year; it is always appreciated!

Felix
