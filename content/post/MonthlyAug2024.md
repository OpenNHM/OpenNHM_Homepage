Welcome to the August 2024 update:

Again a slower month but with some work done on:

- the ISeeSnow paper (we will contact all contributors by the end of autumn)
- improvements on com4FlowPy
- add detrainment more consistently
- update com2AB code structure to fit our current style
- fix and improve analysis plots
