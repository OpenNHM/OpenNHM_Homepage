Welcome to the April 2025 update:

This month we released version [Version 1.12](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.12)

We improved documentation based on user feedback regarding com1DFA null variant and naming, 
and com2AB splitpoints. We added a profile plot example to documentation gallery.

For our Windows users we updated installation instructions. 

Added new functionality for remeshing release thickness raster files similar to DEM remeshing.
