Welcome to the February update:

As you might have noticed, we released two new versions this month:

-[Version 1.10](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.10)

-[Version 1.11](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.11)

So one includes the new geotiff capabilities, while the other one is a maintenance release to update the benchmarks.

So to emphasize this: due to the changes in the IO routines, the benchmarks have changed slightly! This is mostly 
visible in areas on the border of the flow or really strong gradients. However, the differences are well within 
acceptable ranges. But don't take it from us, please see the attached report for the differences (version 1.11).

The work on the regional modelling are in the final stages, with our intern soon to leave us. If you are interested, 
there's currently an open pull request. We expect this to hit the main branch in the next months. 

See you next month. 

Felix
