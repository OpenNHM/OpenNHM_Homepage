Welcome to the first update for 2024 :

This month we held the next public workshop, [see here for the recording](https://avaframe.org/posts/recording2ndworkshop/).
Thanks to all the participants for showing interest in our work.

Furthermore, we addressed a few bug regarding labels in plots and added contour line plots. 
We also added scripts to allow for a probability analysis based on existing sims. This is in relation to ISeeSnow and 
allows for analysis of results not originating from com1DFA.
