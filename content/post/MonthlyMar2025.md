Welcome to the March update:

Apart from the usual bug fixes and improvements, we changed one pain-point by adding mid-run persistence 
(e.g., saving progress/simDF) and resume capability for multi-simulation runs of com1DFA. This allows for restarts
of simulations

Regarding shapefile polygons produced by AvaFrame: these are properly closed (endpoint equals startpoint) now, 
both for idealized release areas and when writing shp files
 
On the admin side, we replaced Code Climate and Codecov with qlty.sh, which is relevant for developers only. 

See you next month. 

Felix
