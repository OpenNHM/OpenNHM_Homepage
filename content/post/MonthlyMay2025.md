Welcome to the May 2025 update:

This month we took part in the INAC 2025 conference, including a talk on 
"New Normative and Digital Instruments in Avalanche Protection" which also had AvaFrame as a topic.

One of the biggest change this month is the switch away from conda to pixi for our development environment. 
The documentation has been updated accordingly.

The project ForestFrame 2 is coming to an end, we are currently working on the report. You can expect some changes
regarding resistance areas in future releases. 

See you next month!

Felix
