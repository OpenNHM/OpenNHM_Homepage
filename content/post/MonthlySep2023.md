Welcome to the September 2023 update:

We released a minor version update to change the separator for release are output statistics file, see[github] 
(https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.6.1) to get more information. 

Some might have noticed, we also enabled downloadable pdfs for our documentation. Now you can take it with you 
wherever you want to go :-).  

Apart from that we did quite a bit of maintenance on our plots and documentation in preparation for the ISeeSnow 
project that's coming up. 

We also had our Steering Meeting, the final one for phase 1. We presented the final report, and now we are finishing 
and adding the last few touches.
