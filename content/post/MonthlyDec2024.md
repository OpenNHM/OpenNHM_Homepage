Welcome to the December 2024 update:

Related to ForrestFrame 2 we are looking into different treatment of resistance forces, experimenting with existing 
approaches and ideas. 
A lot of work is going into the report of the ISeeSnow project, which we aim to publish next year. 

And this is basically a repeat from last month: the regional modelling project is also coming along nicely.  
Current topics are the splitting of larger input areas and efficient handling during computation. 

Related to the rock avalanche module com6, work is being done with helper tools (scarp analysis) and a deeper 
investigation of a suitable standard parameter set.

And with this we wish you all a happy new year and a good start into 2025!

Felix
