Welcome to the second update of 2022.

We are still preparing for the upcoming release, so expect to see some release candidates being published:

- We are preparing a difference report with a comparison between com1DFAOrig and com1DFA. In there we'll look at different
numerical and other investigations, among this is comparison for different particle seeds.

- It is now possible to use a range option to vary thickness values

- Remeshing of the DEMs is improved now: if the remeshing was already done in a previous simulation, remeshing is not
redone, but taken from a saved DEM. This saves some compute time right at the beginning. 

- We are adding code to create simulograms and thalweg-time-diagrams. More on those later... 

- A new, so called *energy line test* now available with its documentation. If you want to know more, head over to our
documentation. 

- We started the process of providing peer-reviewed papers, by starting on different papers. 

We are also looking forward to the 1st public workshop at the 8th of March.
