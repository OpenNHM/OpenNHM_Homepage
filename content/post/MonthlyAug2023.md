Welcome to the August 2023 update:

Well, you might have noticed the new version that was released at the end of August. So our month was basically 
focusing on getting this release out and ironing out the last few niggles of the new functions. Please head over to 
[github](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrame/releases/tag/1.6) to get more information. 

We also had our Scientific Meeting, and we are in full preparation mode for the AvaFrame Phase 2. We are currently 
writing our final report to finish with phase 1. 

Felix
