Welcome to the July 2024 update:

The slower summer months started now, but that doesn't mean nothing is happening:

Apart from plenty of com4FlowPy improvements, we also implemented detrainment in com1DFA resistance areas. This is 
highly experimental and not yet tested. These developments aim at improving the representation for forest 
interaction. They are triggered by a small side project (ForestFrame), which addresses the current status and 
potential improvements of forest representation in com1DFA. Another goal is to provide test cases with forest 
interaction in a separate repository (see [github data repository](https://github.com/avaframe/AvaFrameData)), which 
will hopefully grow bigger in time.
