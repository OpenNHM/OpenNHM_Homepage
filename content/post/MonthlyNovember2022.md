Welcome to the November 2022 update.

This month brought a lot of internal improvements and fixes, apart from one topic:

The dense flow module *com1dfa* now contains the functionality of wall lines. 
These can be utilized to represent the effects of dams. However, please be aware of two things:

- first: this is untested and should only be used for experimental purposes.
- second: the application is directional dams, not catching dams. 

You can learn more about it in our [documentation](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/theoryCom1DFA.html?highlight=dam#dam).

We also met with our operational team, collecting feedback and discussing
current developments. You find some outcomes from that in our issues...

On to the next month, 

Felix
