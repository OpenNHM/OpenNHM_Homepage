Welcome to the April 2024 update:

This month the [EGU 24 ISeeSnow presentation and meeting](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-17750.html)
took place. Thanks to all participants, it was a very interesting and motivating meeting. We will now start with 
collecting and describing all results in a peer reviewed paper. 

We also released [Version 1.8.1](https://avaframe.org/posts/version1_8_1/), which contains a bug fix in com2AB. 

Felix
