Welcome to the June 2023 update:

The function we mentioned last month that creates release area information 
from a given DEM and corresponding release is slowly making its way into the code and the connector. It will be 
included in the next release. 

We also started working on the inclusion of small and medium size calibration values for the friction model. This 
will also be added to the next release. 

One minor change is the renaming of our glidesnow module to snowslide to avoid confusion.
