Welcome to the May 2024 update:

The development this month tackled 3 main topics:

- changes in the way com1DFA handles resistance areas. This includes a breaking change if you adapted your 
  resistance parameters! If you did not adapt them, then no action from your part is needed. The current settings 
  replicate the previous default settings. See the release notes below for more information.  
- adjustments regarding the supported python version in our releases. We dropped python 3.7 and included version 3.12.
- include current developments in com4FlowPy. 

Some of this is packed into [Version 1.8.2](https://avaframe.org/posts/version1_8_2/), which adds python 3.12 
to the releases, and [Version 1.8.3](https://avaframe.org/posts/version1_8_3/), fixing a release pipeline problem.
