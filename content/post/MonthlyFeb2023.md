Another month, another release:

This month's release is version 1.5; please head over to the [release
info](/posts/version1_5/) of *version 1.5* to read more about it. 

- We are also preparing tools for probability map generation. Do not expect this to arrive soon, but it is planned 
  for one of the next versions. 

- And on the admin side of things, we had a Steering Meeting, with a big focus on the next phase of AvaFrame. 

Have fun testing out the new version!

Felix
