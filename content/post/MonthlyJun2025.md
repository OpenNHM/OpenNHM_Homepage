Welcome to the June 2025 update:

As announced, we finished our report on ForestFrame 2 Report, please have a look over at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15592803)
(German only). 

We added new tools for the com6RockAvalanche module: generating scarp and resulting DEMs based on polygons. 

The deployment of releases to pypi was overhauled. It should run more stable now.

Also very exciting: we started to include code and configuration for MoT-PSA as well as MoT-Voellmy by NGI (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/aog.2024.10)). 
We are looking forward to getting this to run and fully calibrated. But it will take some time....

And on the admin side, we had a steering meeting to pring all members of the steering committee up to speed.  

See you in July!

Felix
