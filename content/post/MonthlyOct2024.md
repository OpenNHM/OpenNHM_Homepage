Welcome to the October 2024 update:

This month we are getting ready for our next release, which will contain quite a few things under the hood. 
And fixes a few things for the newest version of python modules. 

Our intern hit the ground running and improved our documentation by adding a part about the advanced 
usage installation on windows. Head over to [advanded installation](https://docs.avaframe.org/en/latest/advancedUsage.html#advanced-installation-windows) if that's relevant for you. 
Expect the next version to come out soon. 

Felix
