We are using https://element.io/ / https://matrix.org/ for our communication.

<!-- Visit our matrix room at:  -->
<!-- [#public:matrix.avaframe.org](https://matrix.to/#/!qmUrKSNurDoVuKAtRU:matrix.avaframe.org?via=matrix.avaframe.org) -->

### You don’t have an element/matrix account:

got to [https://app.element.io/#/register](https://app.element.io/#/register) -> Create Account

You can choose between using:
   - matrix.org, this is the default.
   - your own or another infrastructure (universities, company, …). Setup via: Edit -> add your own homeserver.

Note: It does not matter where your account originates, it works for the whole matrix environment.

Once you’re done, head to the next step:

### You have an element/matrix account

Use a client of your choice (see below) to connect to room

#public:matrix.avaframe.org

You will end up in the Public room in which you can contact us. If this for some reason does not work, send your matrix address to:
@fso:matrix.avaframe.org
and you will be added manually.

### Clients

A comprehensive list of clients can be found here: https://matrix.org/clients/.
Starting with the Element ones (Android/Web/Desktop) is a good beginners choice.
