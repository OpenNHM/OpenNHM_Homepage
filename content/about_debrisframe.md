**Welcome to DebrisFrame: The Future of Debris Flow Simulation**

When it comes to understanding and mitigating the hazards of debris flows, 
we need cutting-edge tools that bridge the gap between the latest science and real-world engineering needs. 
That is where DebrisFrame comes in—a next-generation simulation platform 
designed specifically for the unique challenges of debris flows in the Austrian Alps. 

Built on the powerful open-source foundation of AvaFrame, DebrisFrame takes things to the next level with a focus on 
accessibility, innovation, and practical application.

Here is what makes it stand out: 

* Smart Simulation Tools: Tailored modules for different debris-flow types, hydrograph input options, and advanced
  mass-bulking simulations due to erosion.

* Data-Driven Accuracy: Leveraging real-world data from documented events and monitoring stations to ensure reliable and
  benchmarked results.

* User-Friendly Design: Open-source, modular, and easy to use, with comprehensive documentation to support both
  professionals and researchers.

Our mission? To create a platform that is not only operationally relevant for Austria but also adaptable for global
applications.
Whether you are tackling debris flows in the Alps or beyond, DebrisFrame is built to evolve with the latest research and
your specific needs.

DebrisFrame is currently in an early development phase and new developments will be published soon. 

*DebrisFrame is a cooperation between the Austrian Avalanche and Torrent Service (Wildbach- und Lawinenverbauung; WLV),
the Austrian Research Centre for Forests (Bundesforschungszentrum für Wald; BFW),
both within the Federal Ministry Republic of Austria: Agriculture and Forestry, Climate and Environmental Protection,
Regions and Water management (BMLUK),
and the BOKU University.*
