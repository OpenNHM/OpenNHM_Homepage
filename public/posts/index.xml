      <description>Welcome to this months monthly update (try to say this really fast :-) ) :
  The computational module for AlphaBeta is coming along nicely. We cleaned quite a lot of code and are starting the testing / comparing to reference results (Matthias is working on this).
  Creation of idealised (test) topographies hit our public code base (see github). With these functions the creation of various types of topographies is a breeze (thanks Anna).</description>
