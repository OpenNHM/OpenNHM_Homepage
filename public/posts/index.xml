      <description>Welcome to this years last monthly update.
  This month we concentrated on getting more tests into our repository. We now have included all 6 realistic topographies with release areas and benchmark results in our test scripts. We also expanded our routine testing with pytest to more functions/modules. And those testing DEM&amp;rsquo;s, as well as the release areas, are freely available in the repository, see the data directory.
  The availability of these test cases lead to the release of version 0.</description>

      <description>We just released version 0.2 - The test data release -
Version 0.2 includes the first real world avalanches. It provides data for 6 avalanches, including topographies, release areas and benchmark results. To know more about our data sources, head over to our data sources documentation. The existing test cases also received some updates by including multiple release areas and multiple scenarios per avalanche.
All our standard test can be run by using runStandardTests.</description>

      <description>Welcome to our next monthly update.
  This month started with the exciting (at least for us :-) ) release of version 0.1. Head over to our github repository and our documentation to learn more about it (or read our last post).
  With this release (and the rest of the month as well) we improved our documentation quite a lot. New getting started and installation pages should make it possible for you to get started (ha, who would have guessed.</description>

      <title>Initial release version 0.1</title>

      <description>We are very excited to be able to announce our initial release version 0.1!
This release is the result of several months of development, containing code from different contributors.
 Disclaimer: please be aware that this is our initial release. So expect some (read: a lot of) rough edges!
 You should be able to follow our quick start (only on Linux so far) and produce simulation results for dense flow avalanches.</description>

      <description>Winter has arrived here, so this is basically the first winter update:
This month focused on getting our code base ready for the upcoming release of version 0.1.
  The documentation got a lot of attention with updates and improvements basically everywhere. Most notably we started to include installation and quick start sections for you to follow.
  Testing took a big step forward. We expanded out standard tests, generated more benchmarks and created scripts to run these tests on demand as well as within our continuous integration.</description>

      <description>Winter is slowly creeping up on us, so here is the next AvaFrame update:
  We heavily worked on the dense flow avalanche module com1DFA, bringing functionality from its native code over to python functions. Now there is the option to do parameter variations on friction parameters and release thickness automatically. Besides this new option, more and more simulation parameters can now be set in python.
  Regarding the necessary executable for the com1DFA (dense flow) module: we discovered some discrepancy which we currently work on to resolve.</description>

      <description>Welcome to this months monthly update (try to say this really fast :-) ) :
  The computational module for AlphaBeta is coming along nicely. We cleaned quite a lot of code and are starting the testing / comparing to reference results (Matthias is working on this).
  Creation of idealised (test) topographies hit our public code base (see github). With these functions the creation of various types of topographies is a breeze (thanks Anna).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first installment of our monthly update on AvaFrame.
Every month we want to give you a quick overview of the progress on all things related to AvaFrame.
  This month the project went into full force with 2 new team members: we welcome Anna Wirbel and Matthias Tonnel to the team! More info on the whole team will follow on this homepage.
  The first (development) code is available on github</description>

      <description>The project AvaFrame has officially started with the 1st of June!
We updated the about page with our mission and aims. Information in German can be found here.
The first steering committee and scientific committee meetings already took place and our team members will start soon.
We will continuously keep you updated on this homepage.</description>
